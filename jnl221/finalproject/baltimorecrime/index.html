<h1>What Has Caused the Spike of Crime in Baltimore?</h1>

<h2>Seven years after the murder of Freddie Gray, the City of Baltimore is still facing extremely high homicide rates. Is this due to irreversible damage from the protests, or are there other decisions to blame?</h2>

<p>As Maryland resident Reenie Kraft drove her son to school in Baltimore during the spring of 2015, she continued to be rerouted to new streets, most of which she never took when making the frequent drive. It became evident that the unrest in Baltimore city had reached a new high following the death of Freddie Gray, a black male who was killed due to police brutality. This year, Baltimore saw an increase in all violent crimes with the most prevalent spike being in the homicide count. Now, seven years later, Baltimore continues to see an extremely high murder rate with no signs of slowing down. Is this a result of irreversible damage to the city beginning that April of 2015, or are there additional factors at bay?</p>

      <p>Baltimore, frequently referred to as Charm City, has a long and illustrious history since its establishment in 1729. Due to its location on the water, the city immediately served as a busy port for tobacco and grains. Furthermore, Baltimore became a major entry point for immigrants with over <a href="https://explore.baltimoreheritage.org/items/show/559">1.2 million people</a> landing in the city between the years 1868-1914.  Like many cities, Baltimore has experienced a long history of crime as well. During the Prohibition, Baltimore held many speakeasies and even contained The Baltimore Crew, an Italian-American crime family existing throughout most of the 1900s. Throughout the 1990s, Baltimore was even considered one of the most dangerous cities in the entire United States.</p>

      <p>In the early 2000s, a major push towards cleaning the city up began and for many years helped crime rates drop. Ed and Reenie Kraft, both of whom were Baltimore city residents during this time, felt safe for most of their tenure before moving just outside the city where they now reside. Reenie claims that the real turn for the city came in 2015.</p>

    <p>Murder rates in the city rose 62% between 2014 and 2015. Since then, Baltimore’s homicide number has continued to climb, reaching 348 deaths in 2019, the highest number since 1993. Initial decisions made by Larry Hogan, the newly appointed Governor in 2014, provide additional insight to unrest in the inner city.</p>

    <p>“He came in and basically unwound many years in making inner-city transportation. He came to office and eliminated the Red Line which was supposed to provide many jobs,” says Reenie Kraft.</p>

        <p>Nearly seven years ago, when calls for investment in the city were at a high, Governor Hogan did essentially the opposite. As one of his first choices in office, Hogan canceled the $2.9 billion Red Line plan, an easy access east-to-west light rail system which aimed to not only provide a major influx of jobs, but development and economic growth for some of Baltimore’s lower income neighborhoods.</p>

        <p>“At the same time he sliced the toll to cross the [bay] bridge in half and provided more development in Montgomery County, basically slapping Baltimore in the face,” Reenie states. “When he started ignoring Baltimore it became widely known and caused a lot of push back from the lower class.”</p>

      <p>The governor shifted $736 million of state money towards surrounding cities, most of which are predominantly white and middle to upper class. Ed believes that, with the changes in the city, the Baltimore police force has not done its job to keep the environment safe.</p>

      <p>Despite being the <a href="https://www.baltimorepolice.org/about#:~:text=The%20Baltimore%20Police%20Department%20is,with%20a%20population%20of%20614%2C000">eighth largest municipal police force</a> in the country, the city ranks fifth in total cost of crimes according to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurabegleybloom/2022/02/23/crime-in-america-study-reveals-the-10-most-dangerous-cities-its-not-where-you-think/?sh=6d041e127710">Forbes</a> and third in highest violent crime rates according to <a href="https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-city-rankings/most-violent-cities-in-america">World Population Review</a> in 2022.</p>

      <p>Another perspective could be the rise in gun violence. Due to the increase in shooting over the last decade, this topic has been frequently discussed. Nonetheless, guns have become more accessible than ever within the United States. This trend is supported in the state of Maryland. The amount of guns recorded and traced within Maryland increased from 7,706 in 2014 to 11,096 in 2019 before the COVID-19 pandemic lowered the number into the 9,000s.</p>

      <iframe title="Amount of Guns Recovered in Maryland Between 2014-2021" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-WNvWi" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/WNvWi/2/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="350" data-external="1"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>

      <p>Regardless of its current condition, both Reenie and Ed believe the city can still be fixed.</p>

      <p>Ed believes “the easy, yet not so easy answer [to cleaning up the city] is money. It’s going to take billions of dollars to move the city in the right direction.”</p>

      <p>Reenie is convinced this money needs to be put into infrastructure, cleaned up housing, easier transportation, and schooling. At one point, their family had hopes of returning to Charm City and, while those hopes have been put on hold, they both believe that one day they can retire and live on the harbor.</p></div></div></div>
