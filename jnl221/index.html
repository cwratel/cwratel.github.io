        <p> 
          Between the years 2015-2021 there were 6,061 instances of a fatal police shooting. Most of these were a result of the victim being armed, with a gun being the primary weapon used. However, the most alarming statistic is how many victims were unarmed. The police force has received a lot of scrutiny over the past decade for brutality and avoidable deaths. In 2015, the death of Freddie Gray resulted in violent protests against the police throughout many cities. In 2020, the past repeated itself with George Floyd being yet another avoidable death caused by police brutality. Out of all the fatal police shootings between this time period, 6% or 387 victims were unarmed. This leads to the question, just how can the police force work towards establishing peaceful resolutions in high tension situations, especially when the victim is unarmed.
