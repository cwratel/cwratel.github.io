          In the MLB, all 30 different stadiums have traits that help in defining them. Most baseball fans are aware of certain aspects that make the stadiums unique, such as in the Boston Red Sox’s Fenway Park. A towering 37-foot wall in left field makes it more difficult to hit home runs in that direction. In contrast, in the Colorado Rockies’ Coors Field, home runs are easier to come by due to altitude and how far the ball travels. Park factor uses these traits combined with statistics to determine which stadiums are hitter friendly versus pitcher friendly. In the scatterplot above, park factor is compared to the amount of home runs hit within the respective ballparks between the 2020 and 2022 seasons. Fenway Park produces a very interesting balance in which it is regarded as hitter friendly park but has only the twelfth most home runs. This is most likely due to the major differences between left and right field. As previously mentioned, the “Green Monster” in left field makes it difficult to hit home runs in that direction but right field is a different story. In right field it’s only 302 feet to clear the wall. The short porch in right field helps contribute to the park factor being so high, while the unorthodox difficulty in hitting a home run to left field directly contributes to the lower-than-expected home run count.
